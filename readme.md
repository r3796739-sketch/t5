Yes, you can absolutely use Next.js to create a seamless embed experience for Whop users while keeping your Flask app accessible to non-Whop users. Here's how to implement this architecture:

## Architecture Overview

1. **Next.js App** (runs on Vercel/separate domain): Handles Whop OAuth, serves as embedded iframe inside Whop
2. **Flask App** (your existing app.py): Remains unchanged for endpoints, receives auth tokens from Next.js
3. **Authentication Flow**: Next.js validates Whop users and passes credentials to Flask via postMessage

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up Next.js App Using Whop Template

```bash
# Clone the template
git clone https://github.com/whopio/whop-nextjs-app-template your-app-embed
cd your-app-embed
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Next.js Environment Variables

```env
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID=your_whop_app_id
WHOP_API_KEY=your_whop_api_key
WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_FLASK_APP_URL=https://yourflaskapp.com
```

### 3. Create the Embed Page in Next.js## Key Benefits of This Architecture

### 1. **Seamless Authentication**
Yes, users opening the app in Whop community will be automatically logged in without clicking any button. The Next.js app handles the OAuth flow transparently using Whop SDK's built-in authentication.

### 2. **Your Flask App Knows Everything**
When users access through Whop, your Flask app receives:
- User ID (Whop ID)
- Company/Community ID
- User role (owner/admin/member)
- Email, name, profile picture
- Whether they're embedded or direct access

### 3. **No Changes to Existing Flask Endpoints**
Your existing endpoints remain unchanged. The new `/whop/embed-auth` route handles the embedded authentication separately from your current `/whop/app` route.

### 4. **Dual Access Maintained**
- **Whop users**: Access through embedded iframe with automatic auth
- **Non-Whop users**: Continue using your Flask app directly at yourapp.com

## Additional Configuration Files## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Next.js app to Vercel**:
```bash
vercel deploy
```

2. **Configure Whop App Settings**:
- Set your app URL to: `https://your-nextjs-app.vercel.app/embed`
- Add required OAuth scopes
- Set up webhooks if needed

3. **Update Flask Environment**:
```python
# .env
JWT_SECRET=your-shared-jwt-secret  # Same as Next.js
```

4. **Testing Flow**:
- Whop users open your app in their community
- Next.js automatically authenticates them via Whop SDK
- Creates a JWT token with user info
- Redirects to Flask with the token
- Flask validates token and creates session
- User sees the app with full context (admin/member status)

## Security Considerations

1. **JWT Secret**: Use the same strong secret in both Next.js and Flask
2. **Token Expiry**: Set short expiry times (1 hour) for security
3. **HTTPS Only**: Ensure both apps use HTTPS in production
4. **Domain Validation**: Validate the origin of postMessage communications

This architecture provides the seamless experience you want while maintaining backward compatibility with your existing Flask app for non-Whop users.

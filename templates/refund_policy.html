    <h2>Subscription Cancellation</h2>
    <p>You may cancel your YoppyChat subscription at any time. When you cancel, your subscription will remain active until the end of your current billing cycle. After the cycle ends, you will not be charged again, and your account will be downgraded to the free plan.</p>

    <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>Due to the nature of our digital service and the costs associated with processing YouTube channels and running AI models, we do not offer refunds for subscription fees already paid. When you cancel your service, you are cancelling the next billing charge, not the current one.</p>
    <p>We encourage you to use our free plan to evaluate the service before upgrading to a paid subscription. If you believe you have been charged in error, please contact our support team to resolve the issue.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>

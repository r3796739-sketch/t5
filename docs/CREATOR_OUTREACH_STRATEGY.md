## 🎯 Part 1: Target Creator Niches

Based on YoppyChat's value proposition (AI that answers questions from video content), here are the **highest-value niches** ranked by potential engagement:

---

### 🏆 Tier 1: Highest Value (Should Target First)

| Niche | Why They're Perfect | Pain Point Solved |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Finance & Trading** | Viewers constantly ask "when to buy/sell?", complex topics need repeated explanations | Reduces repetitive DMs about charts, indicators, strategies |
| **Business & Entrepreneurship** | Advice-heavy content, viewers want personalized guidance | Scales 1-on-1 advice without coaching calls |
| **Tech Tutorials & Coding** | Step-by-step content, viewers get stuck on specific steps | AI can answer "how do I do X?" from tutorials |
| **Online Course Creators** | Already monetizing knowledge, need support systems | AI becomes 24/7 course assistant |
| **Productivity & Notion/Tools** | Template-based content, specific "how to" questions | Answers setup questions automatically |

**Example Creators to Target:**
- Trading: Chart analysts, Options educators, Crypto explainers
- Business: Startup advisors, Marketing strategists, Sales coaches
- Tech: Python tutorials, No-code builders, DevOps educators

### 🥈 Tier 2: High Value

| Niche | Why They're Great | Pain Point Solved |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
